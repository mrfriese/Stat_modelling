# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
To familiarize myself with various APIs and extract meaningful data.

## Process
Navigate the City Bike API and gather data on bike availability
Navigate Foursquare and Yelp APIs and compare what can be returned.
Combine results of returned information and show the data in a meaningful way

## Results
The city bike API was straight foreward and was relatively easy to use.
The Foursquare and Yelp APIs had very confusing nesting of data that made it
difficult to extract desired information. 
Because of this difficulty I was not able to complete the project as I would 
have liked, and produced an unuseful model.

## Challenges 
API nested list/dictionary difficulties.
Nan values returned made it difficult to produce any sort of model.

## Future Goals
I would like to come back and start this from scratch, possibly using different information
than restaurant data that might be useful for companies or groups.
